# Image_recognition_model
In this notebook, I trained an image recognition model with python.
The method used is transfer learning(I used a pretrained Convultional Nueral Network but replaced the last layer with a linear classifier).
The pretrained CNN data was collected from 'cognitiveclass.ai'.
I used pytorch for the Deep Learning Neural Network Framework. I also used PIL, Matplotlib & Numpy for Image Processing and Data Visualization.
Due to the large size of the data, I did not share it on my repository. The model reached an accuracy of 88.5% on images never seen before
